# Analysis of the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set

## Background of the Project

The author did the guided project from Coursera: [Exploratory Data Analysis with Seaborn](https://www.coursera.org/programs/36407373-e1fb-4899-802d-0a646ac58f6b?currentTab=MY_COURSES&productId=p6Q7wxtgEeq7pQqHWtJNxQ&productType=course&showMiniModal=true).
The project is about producing visualization using seaborn to visually examine the correlations among features of the Breast Cancer (Diagnostic) Data Set obtained from the UC Irvine repository.

The goal of this repository is to implement what was done in that guided project and then use that as a stepping stone for further analysis. The lecturer of the Coursera project declared that there is a next part in the series but the author cannot find the next guided project. Thus, the author will then move on and do an implementation.
